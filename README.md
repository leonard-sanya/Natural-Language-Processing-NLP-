# Natural-Language-Processing

## Description

This repository contains materials related to Natural Language Processing (NLP). We have implemented various NLP tasks and models in the following folders:

- **Lab1: Text Classification :** In the Lab1 folder, we have implemented a text classification model using both Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression algorithms. You can find the implementation code and relevant files in this folder.

- **Lab2: Word Similarity and Text Translation :** In the Lab2 folder, we have implemented functions to calculate similarities, nearest neighbors, and analogies between words. Additionally, we have defined a model for text translation from English to French. Please refer to the Lab2 folder for more details and the corresponding code.

- **Lab3: N-gram Models :** The Lab3 folder contains the implementation of N-gram models. We have explored the use of N-gram models for various NLP tasks. You can find the code and related files in this folder.

## Installation
- Inorder to run this implementation, clone the repository https:

       https://github.com/leonard-sanya/Natural-Language-Processing-NLP-.git      
      
- Change the directory to the desired task folder. For example, to run the text classification implementation in Lab1, use the following command:

      python main.py
  
- Repeat the above steps for other tasks in their respective folders (e.g., Lab2, Lab3) to run different implementations.
